# Interested in

## Languages

Autism Spectrum, with over-sensory in listening and language, I've leart English and Japanese as Chinese native speaker.

I tend to spell my name as Shin Tzehan instand of Xin Zhihan which is the pinyin scheme. Because the X letter is pronounce Sh and the i in Zhi is a neutral vowel, with the later a in Han, the i in Zhi tend to slide to "e".

## Electrical and Computer Engineering

I obtained a dual degree of B.S. in EE and CS at the year of 2023, and worked in electro-optical industry for the near one year as field electrician in Shenzhen.

Currently (2024/11/29), I'm in Jiangxi and learn skills I want to get.

## Career objects

I want to achieve high positions in industry, for instance seinor engineer and / or engineering manager.

LLMs which are specialist in everyfields changed the world permanently, the question for me is which field to dive into and be the professionals, specialist and technician are no longer enough.
