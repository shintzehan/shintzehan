# About Me

Shin Tzehan, Electrical and Computer Engineer.

## Languages

Trilingual of Chinese, English and Japanese.

I tend to spell my name as Shin Tzehan instant of Xin Zhihan which is the pinyin scheme. Because the x letter is
pronounce sh and the i in zhi is a neutral vowel, with the later a in han, the i in zhi tend to slide to "e".

## Electrical and Computer Engineering

I obtained dual degree in EECS
