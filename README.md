# About Me

Shin Tzehan, Electrical and Computer Engineer.

## Languages

Autism Spectrum with lingual talents, Trilingual of English, Chinese and Japanese.

I tend to spell my name as Shin Tzehan instant of Xin Zhihan which is the pinyin scheme. Because the X letter is
pronounce Sh and the i in Zhi is a neutral vowel, with the later a in Han, the i in Zhi tend to slide to "e".

## Electrical and Computer Engineering

I obtained a dual degree of B.S. in EE and CS at the year of 2023, and worked in electro-optical industry for the near
one year as field electrician in Shenzhen.
