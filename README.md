# About Me

Shin Tzehan, Electrical and Computer Engineer. Trilingual of English, Chinese and Japanese, name in pinyin scheme: Xin Zhihan.

## Language learning

Autism Spectrum, with over-sensory in listening and language, As far as I've leart English and Japanese in my undergraduate period, I am planing to learn French and German in future for curiousity in Mathematics and Physics.

I tend to spell my name as Shin Tzehan instand of Xin Zhihan, in the case of X is confusing and i in Zhi are infact a neutral vowel, with the later a in Han, it would came to e but not i in listening.

## Electrical and Computer Engineering
I obtained a dual degree of B.S. in EE and CS at the year of 2023, and worked in electro-optical industry for the near one year as field electrician in Shenzhen.

I feel that was great experience to learn how electrical signals from computer or other device came and formed into visual impact, but I want to do more in computer engineering, too.

## Carer outlook
My paternal haplogroup is R1a Z93, and I spend 4 years in Harbin (latitude of 45Â°N) for college, this makes me more similar with Russian in the way of mathmetics and computer interested.

I want to earn master's degree for my career that works with smart and kind people, perhaps online mscs from the US institutes would be an option, and I also want to go to Europe for a visit, I plan to learn French and after the online mscs for a m2 degree in France.
